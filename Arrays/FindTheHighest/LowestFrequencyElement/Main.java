//Given an array of size N, we have to find the highest/lowest frequency element in the array.
//the steps are as follows:
//1. Make a visited array of the type boolean.
//2. Use the first loop tp point  to an element of the array.
//3. Initialize the variable count to 1.
//4. Run the second loop, if we find the element then mark the visited index true and then increase the count by 1.
//5. If the visited index is already true then skip the other steps.
//6. After step 5, we will keep a track of the element with the highest/lowest frequency.
